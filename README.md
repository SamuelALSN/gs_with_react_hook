### React Imposible  state
*** 
Here we transform our simulation asynchronous data to reject instead of resolving 
So this cause en Error in our UI 
where 2 states is load
- The state for handling error 
- The state which appear when loading data

These 2 things above cause errors in our UI 

***
Fortunately we can improve our chances by moving states that belong together from multiple useState and useReducer hooks into a single useReducer hook in the Nex commit  
***
This step resolve the problem below : 
Perhaps you've noticed a disconnect between the single states in the App component which seem to belong together because of the useState hooks.

`Technically all the states related to the asynchronous data belong together which doesn't only include the stories as actual data (valeur r√©elles) but all states related
to the asynchronous data belong together, whixh doesn't only include the stories as actual data but also their loading and error states`

***
Caveat :
There is nothing wrong with multiple useState hooks in one React component. Be wary once you see multiple state updater functions in a row, however. These conditional states can lead to impossible states, and undesired behavior in the UI. Try changing your pseudo data fetching function to the following to simulate the error handling:
