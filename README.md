### ADDING TYPESCRIPT REACT 

***
Both the type and isFocused properties are optional. Using TypeScript, you can tell the compiler these donâ€™t need to be passed to the component as props. The children prop has a lot of TypeScript type definitions that could be applicable to this concept, the most universal of which is React.ReactNode from the React library.
