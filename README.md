### DATA FETCHING WITH REACT 
***
irst, the API_ENDPOINT ,(A) is used to fetch popular tech stories for a certain query (a search topic). In this case, we fetch stories about React (B). Second, the native browser’s fetch API is used to make this request (B). For the fetch API, the response needs to be translated into JSON (C). Finally, the returned result follows a different data structure (D), which we send as payload to our component’s state.
